# Summer  2024 - Kaiyan Herrera
## Who Am I?
My name is Kaiyan Herrera, I am a sophmore, I play basketball at chatsworth and I like to eat and be with my friends.

## Sports
This summer I had summer practice and games for Chatsworth. I look forward to playing basketball this season. I need to learn and perfect my craft by the end of this year so I can play Varsity next year. At the moment I feel like i'm not ready to play at that next level, so this next season is really improtant for not just me but my teammates too. I need to be able to push my teammates to get better so they can do the same for me.

I watched Team USA this year and was able to learn a lot from watching them play. I hope to be able to use what I see to help me this season.

## Summer Travel
The main thing I will remember from my summer was going to Great Wolf Lodge for my little brothers birthday. He turned 6 and my family and I decided to go to Great Wolf Lodge so he could enjoy his birthday to the fullest. I loved watching him have fun playing on the waterslides and playing with his cousin.

## Favorite Summer Food
My favorite summer food was probably Korean BBQ. I always love eating all you can eat Korean BBQ. I had it a few times this summer and everytime I had it is was just as good as the last time. The variety I get with pork, steak, and other types and cuts of meat is why I love eating Korean BBQ. Because you cook the raw meat infront of you on the grill, the meat also tastes really fresh because the meat goes from the grill to your plate.
